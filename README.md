# theyoungauthors
## A simple application which retrieves a random post from theyoungauthors.com. 

### What can this application do?
- This application can display random submissions from theyoungauthors.com.
- This application supports users of theyoungauthors.com to log in to the website (using an Android Web View) and add submissions to the site.
- This application offers an alternative to using theyoungauthors.com as a web application.

### How does this appliaction work?
- This application requires only Internet permissions to work on your device.
- The application connects with theyoungauthors.com and requests a random submission (using the random submission feature deployed there).
- The application then parses the submission to display only the text in an Android Web View.

### Alright, now let me download the thing!
- [Please find the 1.0 version of theyoungautors Android application here: Download](https://github.com/marcaufderheyde/theyoungauthors/raw/master/MyFirstApp/app/release/app-release.apk)

### Some things to note:
- The scraper, get_random_post.py, is custom written specifically for theyoungauthors.com. It may not work for any other Wordpress sites. I'm not sure, I haven't tested it.
- Different larger screen sizes might have some weird UI effects...
- This Application is arguably unnecessary, YOLO. Don't @ me <3
